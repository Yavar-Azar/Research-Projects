# PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS

Application of the halide perovskite (HP) in the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by Kojima was a turning point in the timeline of photovoltaic technology. The unique features of these materials like deep diffusion length, large defect tolerance, and efficient light absorption leads to notable advance in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite-based cells from 4\% in 2009 to 23\% in 2019.
